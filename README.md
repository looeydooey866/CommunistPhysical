## **Current Features**

1. **Vectors**
   - **Vector Addition and Subtraction**: Perform precise calculations for combining or resolving vectors.
   - **Vector Equations**: Supports operations such as scalar-vector multiplication for advanced equation handling.
   - **Coordinate Conversion**: Seamlessly convert between polar and rectangular coordinate systems.
   - **Desmos Visualisation Compatibility**: Beautifully convert your vectors into equations that can be plugged in to Desmos for viewing!
   - **Pyplot Visualisation Compatibility**: Draw your vectors using the pyplot function! You can either save or directly display your graph.

## **In Progress**

- **Velocity Class**  
  A dedicated class to represent and calculate velocities, including support for magnitude and direction.

- **Acceleration Class**  
  A class to manage acceleration calculations, facilitating the analysis of changing velocities over time.

- **Particle Class**
   A class which allows you to create a Particle, supporting calculations of position, velocity, acceleration, force, momentum, energy, gravity and more.

- **Point Mass Class**
  A class which allows you to create a Point Mass object, which can have multiple forces applied on it.

## **To contribute,**
- Always create a new branch for your new feature/edit.
- Commit early and often to avoid a big chunk of changes.
- Before merging, create a pull request and confirm with others if it is valid.
- Ensure that your code is readable and your variable/function names make sense to the developers.
- Do join the Discord server for updates and discussion with other devs (Email our.soviet.solutions@gmail.com to request an invite.)
